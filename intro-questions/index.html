		<h1>About Me!</h1>
		<h2>Q & A</h2>
		<p>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).<br>
		<em>My name is Lily Greenwald. I am junior, double majoring in Communication Design and Art History.</em></p>
		<p>2. Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.<br>
		<em>I have been taking art classes since before I can remember. I took Interaction Foundations because it is a requirement for my major, which is filled with more art classes for me to take.</em></p>
		<p>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.<br>
		<em>During my first semester freshman year, I took Intro to Computer Science where I was taught the basics of JavaScript. I didn't click with it per say, but I did find it extremely interesting and amazing when I was able to make something work. Last semester, we were assigned a project in HTML in which everyone created a very basic web design to display an article each of us hand picked.</em></p>
		<p>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.<br>
		<em>I hope to learn how to design with HTML as well as, if not better than, I can in InDesign for print.</em></p>
		<p>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.<br>
		<em>Designing for screen will be different than designing for paper because for screen there are various sizes to think about. I have to be aware of how the design will look on a monitor, versus a 13 inch screen, a phone or a tablet.</em></p>
		<p>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.<br>
		<em>I think the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">New York Times website</a> is a great example of a well designed website because they have to fit a lot of information into one place and they execute the task with clarity.</em></p>
		<p>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.<br>
		<em><a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix's website</a> communicates their services well. They break their entire library up into clear sections based off of shows and movies you have already watched. Besides that, he Netflix originals are in one row while the New Releases are in another.</em></p>
		<p>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice. <br>
		<em>Facebook works extremely well considering how many people use it a time. They are constantly updating to allow for clear and quick communication. With the <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook website</a>, everything has its place and purpose.</em></p>
