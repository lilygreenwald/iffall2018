		<h1>Hide and Seek</h1>
		<h2>Imogen Heap</h2> <br>


		<p>Where are we? <br>
		What the hell is going on? <br>
		The dust has only just begun to fall, <br>
		Crop circles in the carpet sinking, feeling. <br>
		Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. <br>
		This can't be happening. <br>
		When busy streets a mess with people <br>
		Would stop to hold their heads heavy.</p> <br>

		<p>Hide and seek. <br>
		Trains and sewing machines. <br>
		All those years they were here first.</p> <br>

		<p>Oily marks appear on walls <br>
		Where pleasure moments hung before. <br>
		The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life. </p> <br>
		
		<p>Hide and seek.<br>
		Trains and sewing machines.</p>

		<p class="par">(Oh, you won't catch me around here)</p>> 
		
		<p>Blood and tears </p>

		<p class="par">(hearts)</p>
		<p>They were here first.</p> <br>

		<p>Mmm, what'd you say? <br>
		Mmm, that you only meant well? Well, of course you did. <br>
		Mmm, what'd you say? <br>
		Mmm, that it's all for the best? Of course it is. <br>
		Mmm, what'd you say? <br>
		Mmm, that it's just what we need? And you decided this. <br>
		What'd you say? <br>
		Mmm, what did she say?</p> <br>

		<p>Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth.<br> 
		Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cutouts. <br>
		Speak no feeling, no, I don't believe you. <br>
		You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. </p> <br>

		<p class="par">(hide and seek)</p>

		<p>Oh, no, you don't care a bit. <br>
		Oh, no, you don't care a bit. <br>
		Uh-uh, you don't care a bit. <br>

		<p class="par">(hide and seek)</p>

		<p>You don't care a bit. <br>
		You don't care a bit.</p> <br>
